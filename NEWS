* Changes in version 0.16.4 (2023-12-17)
** =private-key-from-file= now allows to read encrypted keys
The procedure =private-key-from-file= from =(ssh key)= now has optional
=#:auth-callback= and =#:user-data= keys that allow to specify a callback
procedure to read the password for an encrypted key, and optionally pass to
the callback procedure some user data.

The Texinfo documentation for =private-key-from-file= is updated with an usage
example.

New tests were added for the new functionality.
** Add GNU Guix workflows for GitHub CI
Now Guile-SSH has GNU Guix workflows for GitHub CI.

Platforms:
- x86_64-linux-gnu
- aarch64-linux-gnu

Thanks to Sharlatan Hellseher <sharlatanus@gmail.com>
** Fix typos in the documentation
Some typos in =doc/api-popen.texi= are fixed, thanks to
Maxim Cournoyer <maxim.cournoyer@gmail.com>

* Changes in version 0.16.3 (2023-01-29)
** Fix Guile-SSH/libssh channel leak
Guile-SSH channel would always "leak" the libssh channels when the remote side
issued the closing request.  Now this bug is fixed by freeing libssh channel
when the remote side is closed.

Reported by Andrew Tropin <andrew@trop.in> in
<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=58290>

The test for reproducing the problem was provided by Ludovic Courtès
<ludo@gnu.org>.

* Changes in version 0.16.2 (2023-01-02)
** Bugfix in test "string->public-key, ECDSA"
The test used to explicitly compare libssh version with "9" so it would always
fail on platforms with libssh 0.10.  Now the test does numerical comparison
and uses "ecdsa-p256" on platforms that have libssh 0.9 or later version.

Reported by Vagrant Cascadian, here:
<https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/34>

* Changes in version 0.16.1 (2022-12-31)
** Disable the tests that require DSA algorithm by default
When DSA support is disabled in libssh (which is the default state since
libssh 0.10) all DSA-related Guile-SSH procedures will fail.  Now Guile-SSH
disables by default all the tests that are require the DSA algorithm support
by default.

Although those changes do not affect the Guile-SSH API directly, users should
be aware that DSA support will be removed altogether in the next major libssh
release.

Reported by Vagrant Cascadian, here:
<https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/34>
** Add '--enable-dsa' Autoconf option
'configure.ac' now has '--enable-dsa' option that allows to enable DSA public
key algorithm support in Guile-SSH.
** (ssh version): 'dsa-support?': New procedure
** guix.scm: Use libssh 0.10.0
The development GNU Guix environment now uses libssh 0.10.0.

* Changes in version 0.16.0 (2022-09-13)
** Fix Guile snarfer environment
Fix a bug introduced in Guile-SSH 0.15.0 that breaks the cross-compilation.

Reported by Ludovic Courtes <ludo@gnu.org> here:
<https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/30>
** New API: SFTP Directory
Guile-SSH now allows directory traversal by means of the new procedures in the
(ssh sftp) module.
** Update the documentation.

* Changes in version 0.15.1 (2022-02-28)
** Fix session garbage collecting errors
   When a session is being destroyed by the Guile GC, the session garbage
   collector procedures try to close all the session channels.  There was a
   bug that lead to accessing elements that are over the border of a channels
   list.

   Now the bug should be fixed.

   Reported by Ludovic Courtès <ludo@gnu.org> in an email, here:
   <https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=52975>
** Fix segfaults that occur on session closing
   When a remote side closing a channel Guile-SSH would fail as the libssh
   callback that marks the Guile-SSH channel as closed tried to convert a
   Guile channel object to the channel data and fails to do it.

   Now the problem should be fixed.

   Reported by Ludovic Courtès <ludo@gnu.org> in an email, here:
   <https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=52975>
** Add GNU Guix package definition to the repository
   Add =guix.scm= to the repository.  The file contains GNU Guix package
   definition that allows to build Guile-SSH from Git.

* Changes in version 0.15.0 (2022-01-03)
** Bump library version to "14:0:0" according to libtool rules
   In the 0.14.0 release of Guile-SSH the libtool library version wasn't
   properly changed.  This could lead to compatibility problems.

   Now the version is bumped to "14:0:0".
** Remove requirement for 'whereis' command
   Guile-SSH required 'whereis' from 'util-linux' package to find
   'guile-snarf' command.  Now this dependency is removed.
* Changes in version 0.14.0 (2021-12-20)
** API change: OpenSSH agent procedures are now in (ssh agent)
   Move agent procedures to (ssh agent) module from (ssh auth).

   The procedures are renamed and improved too. The current set of procedures
   provided by (ssh agent) is as follows:
   - ssh-agent-sock-get
   - ssh-agent-sock-set!
   - ssh-agent-start
   - ssh-agent-info

   The documentation is updated accordingly.
** API change: Remove 'sftp-init' from (ssh sftp)
   This procedure was not present in the module anyway, so this is more like a
   bugfix though.

   If you need to call SFTP init, you can use low-level '%sftp-init' procedure
   (although this is discouraged.)
** Guile-SSH channels are now explicitly blocking by default
** Fix snarfing errors on Fedora GNU/Linux
   Guile-SSH would fail to find 'guile-snarf' script on Fedora GNU/Linux when
   GNU Guile 2.2 installed because the snarfer installed as 'guile-snarf2.2'.
   Now the problem is fixed.
** Fix random segfaults due to libssh logging
   The library would sometimes get segfaults due to libssh logging.

   Guile-SSH used to pass Guile objects to a libssh logging procedure as a
   opaque pointers, and some Guile objects didn't make it to the point when an
   actual Scheme callback procedure called, GC'ted on the way. So when a
   Scheme logging callback tried to use its parameters, the parameters was
   freed already.

   Now Guile-SSH bypasses libssh logging altogether, calling a Scheme logging
   callback right away -- that provides more control over Scheme objects and
   allows to keep them from GC'ing.
** Fix "random" errors and segfaults in channels
   Guile-SSH would sometimes fail with segmentation faults and other errors
   when a remote side is abruptly closed the connection and the client side
   still tries to read data.

   Now in that situation reading a Guile-SSH channel results in EOF.
** Fix test failures due to 'primitive-fork' calls
   SRFI-64 doesn't really like tests that spawn new processes and try to do
   stuff after 'primitive-fork' without calling 'execle' (or similar)
   procedure: sometimes a test would fail even when all its test cases where
   successful.

   Now that should be fixed.

** Fix the tests for Guile 3.0.7
   There are differences in REPL welcome message between Guile 3.0.7 and older
   versions.  Now this difference is handled properly.

   Reported by Ludovic Courtès in
   <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/28>

** Fix the tests for Guile 3.0.5
   The test-runner object is now reset to #f when calling the 'test-end'
   procedure. See the commit de5d1a7f99b8e952b115237ebc29633062f99bb9 in Guile
   (srfi-64: Reset test-runner-current if done) which introduced this change.

** The Guile-SSH building process now less verbose

** Update documentation

* Changes in version 0.13.1 (2020-08-19)
** Fix segfaults on GC'ing
   The library would always fail with segmentation fault when the GC tried to
   free Guile-SSH session when Guile-SSH channels related to this sessions
   were in use.

   Now live channels prevent the keep Guile-SSH session from freeing.
** Channels procedures now check if the parent session is alive
    Channels procedures now check if the parent session is alive and
    connected.  If this is not the case, an guile-ssh-error is issued.

* Changes in version 0.13.0 (2020-07-18)
** API change: 'call-with-ssh-forward' does not start a thread
   The procedure does not start a thread because multi-threading with libssh
   sometimes leads to random segfaults.

   Now 'call-with-ssh-forward' calls the provided procedure with a channel as
   an argument instead.

   If you wish to have a socket that forwards all the data to the remote side
   through an SSH channel, you should implement a separate process that
   forwards the data. There is an example in the directory 'examples/rpc' that
   shows how to implement such a forwarding.
** API change: add 'nodelay' option for Guile-SSH sessions
   Thanks to Lars-Dominik Braun.
** Fix some random segfaults in the channel and session code
** Add support for macOS
   Now Guile-SSH can be installed on macOS through a Homebrew Tap:
   https://github.com/aconchillo/homebrew-guile

   Thanks to Aleix Conchillo Flaqué!
** Disable libguile-ssh static library
   This change is a part of poring Guile-SSH to macOS.
** Don't use deprecated libssh procedures
   Add additional checks that replace deprecated procedures with the new ones
   when newer libssh library is present.
** Changes in documentation
   Fix Texinfo warnings.

* Changes in version 0.12.0 (2020-01-05)
** API change: Implement new version of the RREPL API
   As proposed by Ludovic Courtès, this Guile-SSH version includes an
   implementation of a new stateless RREPL.
** New module: (ssh agent)
   The module contains procedures for interaction with running SSH agent
   instances.
** Prepare for Guile 2.9/3.0
   Allow to build Guile-SSH with Guile versions 2.0, 2.2, 3.0.

   Pull request has been made by Ludovic Courtès in
   <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/pull/14>
** Remove bundled SRFI-64
   This test framework is included in Guile since version 2.0.12.

   This request has been made by Ludovic Courtès in
   <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/pull/14>
** Cross-compilation support
   Now Guile-SSH should allow cross-compilation.

   Pull request has been made by Mathieu Othacehe in
   <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/pull/16>
** Changes in (ssh auth):
*** New procedure 'userauth-gssapi!'
    The procedure allows to authenticate through GSSAPI (Generic Security
    Services Application Program Interface.)

    Pull request has been made by Lars-Dominik Braun in
    <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/pull/15>
** Generic compilation fixes
   Fix some warnings that surface during compilation and linking.
** Bugfixes
*** Fix a segfault in 'libguile-ssh'
    The library would always fail with segmentation fault error when an
    application tried to free a closed channel.  Now it should be fixed.

    Reported by Michael Bowcutt <mbowcutt@case.edu> in
    <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/8>
    and Njagi Mwaniki in a personal email.
*** Fix building with libssh 0.8
    The 'libguile-ssh' library would fail to build due to missing
    'libssh_threads' library that was removed libssh 0.8.  Now 'libguile-ssh'
    builds without 'libssh_threads' when using libssh 0.8+.

    Reported by lantw44 in
    <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/9>
*** Fix failing tests
    Tests would fail from time to time due to problems with an implementation
    of the Guile-SSH testing framework.  Now Guile-SSH uses updated (and
    hopefully better) version of tests; that should fix most of the failures.

    Reported by Pilifer, Carl Dong and Vagrant Cascadian in
    <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/12>

* Changes in version 0.11.3 (2018-03-27)
** Bugfixes
*** 'node-run-server' now checks for errors
    When 'node-run-server' fails to start the server it would go down an
    infinite loop.  The procedure now checks if the RREPL server started
    correctly and throws 'node-error' if it's not.

    Reported by Marius Bakke and Ludovic Courtès, in
    <https://bugs.gnu.org/30522>
 
* Changes in version 0.11.2 (2017-06-18)
** Bugfixes
*** Always reset the channel and sftp streams when closing ports
    In Guile 2.2 objects (and thus Guile-SSH channels) are finalized in a
    separate finalizer thread, but libssh does not work properly in such a
    multi-threaded fashion -- which leads to segfaults in Guile-SSH.

    To address that problem the following changes are made:
    - In (ssh dist node) REPL channels opened in 'node-eval' are closed
      explicitly.
    - Channels and SFTP streams are always reset when closing ports.

    Thanks to Ludovic Courtès for the patches!

    Reported by Ludovic Courtès and Mark H Weaver, in
    <https://bugs.gnu.org/26976>
*** In (ssh dist node)
**** 'node-guile-version' now does not fail
     The procedure would always fail to get Guile version.  Now that should be
     fixed.

     Reported by Mark H Weaver and Ludovic Courtès, in
     <https://bugs.gnu.org/26976>
*** In (ssh session)
**** 'session-set!' now throws an option with its value on an error
*** In (ssh channel)
**** Printing a channel now works with Guile 2.2
**** 'channel-get-exit-status' handle freed channels properly
     'channel-get-exit-status' now handles freed channels properly by throwing
     'wrong-type-arg' error.
**** Printing a freed channel doesn't lead to SIGSEGV anymore
     Guile-SSH would always crash with SIGSEGV errors when tried to print a
     freed channel object (e.g. after calling 'close' on a channel).  This bug
     is fixed now by introducing new checks.

     Now a freed channel will be printed like this:
       #<unknown channel (freed) 9412f0>
** Update unit tests
*** Add test cases for fixed bugs
** Misc
*** Improve logging

* Changes in version 0.11.1 (2017-05-09)
** Bugfixes
*** Fix building scripts
    The building process would always fail on fresh source tree because
    'configure' tried to make a symlink or a copy of files that were not
    present yet.  This should be fixed by now.

    Reported by Ludovic Courtès, on #guix IRC channel.

* Changes in version 0.11.0 (2017-05-09)
** Add support of Guile 2.2
   Tested with GNU Guile version 2.0.14 (on Gentoo GNU/Linux) and
   2.2.2.3-0c102 (on Debian GNU/Linux.)

   Many thanks to Ludovic Courtès for patches!
** New module (ssh shell)
   The module provides some procedures build upon (ssh popen) module for
   working with remote shell.
** Bugfixes
*** In (ssh tunnel)
**** 'main-loop' now handles "interrupted system call" errors
     that sometimes occur on 'select' call.
*** In (ssh dist node)
***** 'rrepl-get-result' now handles compilation errors
      The procedure would always fail to read compilation errors properly
      because it considered the message as "undefined" result.  Now this bug
      should be fixed.

      An example of an error that now should be handled is "no code for module"
      due to using a non-existing module in 'with-ssh' expression.

      Reported by Mathieu, in
      <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/3>
***** 'rrepl-get-result' now handles "unbound variable" errors
      The procedure would always fail to read "unbound variable" errors
      properly, returning wrong result with only two values (current module
      name and current language name).  Now this bug should be fixed.

      Reported by Mathieu, in
      <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/3>
***** 'rrepl-get-result' now handles unknown # objects
      The procedure would always fail to read unknown objects (e.g. instances
      of Guile-SSH session) properly, raising an obscure errors like
      "Unknown # object: #\<".  Now the procedure raises 'node-repl-error'
      with full evaluation result gotten from RREPL.

      Reported by Mathieu, in
      <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/3>
** Changes in (ssh dist node)
*** 'node-eval' now can work without procps
    The procedure now checks if procps package is present on a node and uses
    fallback Guile-SSH implementation of 'pgrep' and 'pkill' if it is not.
    The fallback implementation of 'pgrep' is built upon pure bash, and
    'pkill' in addition requires Guile itself on the remote side.
*** New procedure 'node-loadavg'
    The procedure can be used to get average load of a node.
** Changes in (ssh dist)
   Procedures in the module now are capable of checking presence of procps
   package on a remote side and switching to fallback implementation of some
   of the procps tools when the package is not present -- thanks to updated
   'node-eval' procedure (see above.)

   At the end of the day it means that now the code can start/stop Guile REPL
   server on a remote side even without procps installed.
** Update unit tests
*** Add test cases for (ssh shell) module
** Update documentation
*** Add documentation for (ssh shell) module
*** Describe project goals in "Introduction" section

* Changes in version 0.10.2 (2016-11-25)
** New procedures
*** New procedure 'channel-send-eof' in (ssh channel)
    The procedure allows to send end-of-file (EOF) on a channel. This action
    doesn't close the channel; you may still read from it but not write.
    'channel-send-eof!' is handy when we deal with a remote command that reads
    data until EOF (such as 'wc'.)
** Documentation
*** Add procedure index
** Misc
*** Fixed several compilation warnings

* Changes in version 0.10.1 (2016-10-09)
** Bugfixes
*** Fix SMOB freeing callbacks
    Callbacks for many Guile-SSH objects would always fail to free allocated
    resources due to wrong check added in 0.10.0.  The problem should be fixed
    now.
** Change default 'guilesitedir' to 'PREFIX/share/guile/site/X.Y'
   from 'PREFIX/share/guile-ssh/ssh/'

* Changes in version 0.10.0 (2016-08-20)
** Add support of Guile 2.0.12
   Guile-SSH now builds (and works quite well, as far as I can see) with Guile
   2.0.9 and 2.0.12.  Unit tests are passing too.

   Tested on:
   - Gentoo GNU/Linux, Guile 2.0.12-r1, libssh 0.7.3
   - Gentoo GNU/Linux, Guile 2.0.9-r1, libssh 0.7.3
** Add support of libssh 0.7.3
   Guile-SSH now supports libssh 0.7.3 and (probably) newer versions; haven't
   tested.

   Note that [[https://www.libssh.org/2016/02/23/libssh-0-7-3-security-and-bugfix-release/][CVE-2016-0739 was found in previous libssh versions]]; though you
   may still use 0.6.4, you really should stick with 0.7.3+ for aforementioned
   reason. 0.7.3 is already should be in your distro's repository, so that
   won't be a big deal I guess.
** Bugfixes
*** (ssh dist node)
**** 'node-server-running?' now checks the default port
     The procedure now checks for Guile server running on the default port
     (that is, with '--listen' option without an argument), if that port was
     specified for the node.
*** Fix include errors and misspecified inline procedures in C code
    These errors lead to build failures (reported on Arch GNU/Linux, see
    <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/1>.)
*** Don't merge stderr with stdout in remote pipes
    See <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh/issues/2>.
** Examples
*** Add 'uptop' example
** Update documentation
** Unit tests
   Expand test suite, improve existing tests.  Namely tests now don't always
   fail when '-j' option is used with 'make check', with value greater than 1
   (e.g. '-j4'; tested on Gentoo GNU/Linux, 4-core Intel Atom CPU)

   Though sometimes tests fail, so there's still a room for improvement.

   Another improvement is that SRFI-64 module and Guile-SSH common test module
   are now compiled before use, that should speed up the tests.


* Changes in version 0.9.0 (2015-12-24)
** Bugfixes
*** Fix a bug in distributed forms in handling of REPL errors
    Distributed procedures now throw an 'node-repl-error' on an evaluation
    error instead of returning of an unspecified value.
*** Fix a bug in handling of strings in distributed forms
    The 'rrepl-eval' was always failing to send sexps that contain strings in
    the proper way because the procedure uses the human-readable printing to
    transmit the data.  As the result an RREPL fails to evaluate it and
    reports an error.  The bug is fixed by switching to the machine-readable
    data printing.
*** 'dist-map' and 'distribute' now raise an error if an evaluation failed
    instead of silently return an empty list.
*** 'channel-listen-forward' now returns a correct port number
    'channel-listen-forward' would always return garbage as the 2nd argument
    when called with port > 0.  Now when the port is explicitly specified then
    the procedure returns the specified port as the 2nd argument.
*** Add missing export of 'node-tunnel' from (ssh dist node) module
** Changes in API
*** Distributed forms now return the number of evaluation as a number
    instead of string.
*** 'with-ssh' is now capable of handling of multiple values
    'with-ssh' now returns a vector of values if an expression was evaluated to
    multiple values.  'distribute' and 'dist-map' only take the 1st value if
    multiple values were returned by an expression.
*** Nodes are now capable of starting and stopping a remote REPL (RREPL)
    The new behaviour is controlled by 'start-repl-server?' and
    'stop-repl-server?' keyed options of 'make-node'.  Stopping of a RREPL
    server is disabled by default.
*** Channels now can be created as input, output or bi-drectional ports
    The direction of a channel is controlled by the 2nd argument to
    'make-channel' procedure.
*** 'make-session' now takes 'config' option
    that allows to specify whether the SSH config should be parsed or not, and
    optionally the path to the config.
** New procedures
*** New procedure 'node-server-running?' in (ssh dist node)
*** New procedure 'node-run-server' in (ssh dist node)
*** New procedure 'node-stop-server' in (ssh dist node)
*** New procedure 'node-guile-version' in (ssh dist node)
*** New procedure 'session-parse-config!' in (ssh session)
** New modules
*** (ssh popen)
    Remote popen interface to interact with remote processes.
*** (ssh sftp)
    SFTP interface that allows to operate on remote files.
** Documentation
*** Move description of tunnels into a separate section
*** Add description of the new procedures
*** Update existing documentation
** Unit tests
*** Expand the test suite for distributed forms
*** Expand the test suite for tunnels
** Add the project logo

* Changes in version 0.8.0 (2015-08-04)
** Implement port forwarding
** Add distributed forms
** Require libssh 0.6.4 or 0.6.5
** New module: (ssh tunnel)
   The module provides hi-level procedures for SSH tunneling.
** New module: (ssh dist)
   The module provides distributed forms of 'map' and 'eval', as well as
   remote REPL (RREPL) implementation.
** New module: (ssh dist job)
   Low-level API for distributed jobs.
** New module: (ssh dist node)
   Low-level API for distributed nodes.
** New procedure 'channel-accept-forward' in (ssh channel)
** New procedure 'channel-listen-forward' in (ssh channel)
** Remove 'channel-open-forward/reverse' procedure from (ssh channel)
** Examples
*** Add an RPC client example
    Add an example program that does an RPC call over a secure channel using
    a Guile-SSH tunnel.  See 'examples/rpc' directory.
*** Add a RREPL example
    Add a demo program that connects to a remote REPL (RREPL).
** Update documentation

* Changes in version 0.7.2 (2015-02-24)
** Remove dependency on libgcrypt added by a mistake
** Fix "double free or corruption" error on GC'ing of keys
   Fix "double free or corruption" error that occures in case when a key was
   derived from an authentication message by means of `message-get-req'.  When
   such a key is GC'ed then GC'ing of its parent message leads to error, or
   vice versa.
** Fix a bug in the channel implementation
   The bug could occasionally manifest itself on channel reading as the
   following error:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
guile: ports.c:1476: scm_i_fill_input: Assertion `pt->read_pos == pt->read_end' failed.
#+END_EXAMPLE
** New `server-get' procedure in (ssh server)
   The procedure can be used to retrieve server options.
** New `channel-get-exit-status' procedure in (ssh channel)
   The procedure allows to get exit status of an executed command from a
   channel.
** New `channel-request-send-exit-status' procedure in (ssh channel)
   The procedure can be used to send the exit status to a client.
** Improve printing of Guile-SSH server objects
   Print the bind address of a server object and its bind port.  Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#<server 127.0.0.1:12345 9b70ff0>
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Update examples
*** sssh
    - Check exit status of an executed command.
*** ssshd
    - Send exit status to the client according to the result of command
      execution.
*** echo server and client
    - Some cosmetic changes aimed to make the code cleaner.
** Update documentation
   - Add description of the new procedures.
   - Update examples.

* Changes in version 0.7.1 (2014-10-11)
** New `%get-libssh-version' procedure in (ssh version)
   The procedure can be used to get libssh version in the "raw" format such
   as: "0.6.3/openssl/zlib".
** New `get-crypto-library' procedure in (ssh version)
   The procedure returns name of a cryptographic library with which libssh was
   compiled.
** New `zlib-support?' procedure in (ssh version)
   The procedure checks if zlib support is enabled in libssh.
** New `set-log-verbosity!' procedure in (ssh log)
   The procedure sets global libssh log verbosity.
** New `get-log-verbosity' procedure in (ssh log)
   The procedure gets global libssh log verbosity.
** New `make-keypair' procedure in (ssh key)
   The procedure can be used to generate a new keypair with the specified
   parameters.
** New `private-key-to-file' procedure in (ssh key)
   The procedure can be used to export a private key to a file (doesn't work
   if libssh 0.6.3 is compiled with GCrypt).
** Changes in tests
*** Fix "end of file" errors in tests
   Fix the following kind of errors in tests:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ERROR: In procedure scm_i_lreadparen: /path/to/guile-ssh/sources/tests/./client-server.scm:272:34: end of file
#+END_EXAMPLE
   Thanks to Ludovic Courtès for reporting the issue and for a good advice how
   to fix that.
*** Don't perform ECDSA key tests if libssh is compiled with GCrypt
    libssh 0.6.3 does not support ECDSA keys if compiled with GCrypt instead
    of OpenSSL.  Thus, ECDSA key tests used to fail.  Now there is a check
    that prevents these tests from execution in case when libssh 0.6.3 is
    compiled with GCrypt.
** Update documentation
   - Add description of the new procedures.
   - Add note about ECDSA keys support with GCrypt library.

* Changes in version 0.7.0 (2014-08-31)
** Require GNU Guile 2.0
** Require libssh 0.6.3
** Change `get-public-key-hash'
*** Move the procedure to (ssh key)
*** Return the hash as a bytevector
*** Accept a public key as the first argument
*** Accept a hash type as the second argument
    Possible types are: 'md5, 'sha1
** (ssh auth) procedures now throw an exception if the session is not connected
** (ssh channel) procedures now handle closed and freed channels
   - `channel-open?' returns `#f' if the channel has been closed freed.
   - `channel-open-session' and `channel-eof?' throw to `guile-ssh-error' if
     the channel has been closed and freed.
   - `channel-request-env', `channel-request-exec', `channel-request-pty',
     `channel-request-shell', `channel-set-pty-size!', `channel-set-stream!',
     `channel-get-stream' now throw `wrong-type-arg` if the channel is closed.
** Some (ssh session) procedures now throw an exception if the session is not connected
   These procedures are:
   - `get-protocol-version'
   - `authenticate-server'
   - `get-server-public-key'
   - `write-known-host!'
** Change `userauth-pubkey!'
*** Rename it to `userauth-public-key!'
*** Change arguments
** `blocking-flush!' now returns `error' symbol on error
   instead of throwing of an exception
** `connect!' now returns `error' symbol on error
   instead of throwing of an exception
** `authenticate-server' now returns `error' symbol on error
   instead of throwing of an exception
** `private-key-from-file' now takes only a file name
** New (ssh log) module
** Rename `userauth-pubkey-auto!' to `userauth-public-key/auto!'
** New `userauth-public-key/try' procedure in (ssh auth)
** New `bytevector->hex-string' procedure in (ssh key)
** New `channel-open-forward' procedure in (ssh channel)
** New `channel-open-forward/reverse' procedure in (ssh channel)
** New `session-get' procedure in (ssh session)
** New `channel-get-session' procedure in (ssh channel)
** New `message-get-session' procedure in (ssh message)
** Improve printing of Guile-SSH objects
*** Print more detailed information about `session' object
    Print user name, host name and current state of a `session' object.
*** Print object address for `channel' object
*** Print object address for `message' object
*** Print object address for `key' object
** Changes in tests
*** Add tests for Guile-SSH keys
*** Add tests for `authenticate-server' procedure
** Bug fixes
*** Fix a GC issue
    Keep a reference to the parent session in channels and messages to prevent
    the session from premature GC'ing.  Without that GC could free a session
    even if there are live channels and by that break the channels.
*** `public-key?' and `private-key?' now produce correct result
    Functions now return `#f' if the given argument is not a Guile-SSH
    key object.
** Documentation update
*** Fix old URLs to Guile-SSH repository in the `Installation' chapter
*** Add an overview of programming with Guile-SSH to the "Examples" chapter

* Changes in version 0.6.0 (2014-03-23)
** Remove username from parameter list of auth procedures
   `userauth-password!' and `userauth-pubkey!' don't take a username
   as a parameter anymore.  Rationale: According to libssh 0.6 docs,
   most server implementations do not permit changing the username
   during authentication.  Moreover, the parameter was deprecated in
   libssh 0.5.3.

   Elimination of the username makes Guile-SSH Auth API clearer and
   simpler.  Username can be set either on creation of a session or by
   calling of `session-set!' procedure.
** `server-accept' now throws `guile-ssh-error' on error
** Improve reads from channels
   Return EOF immediately if the channel is closed instead of polling
   it for data (which causes notable latency on the first read).
   Thanks Ludovic Courtès for the patch.
** Compile Guile modules
   Compile Guile modules and install compiled files if GNU Guile 2.0.x
   is available.
** Update Texinfo documentation
*** Update Auth API description
*** Update Server API description
*** Update Acknowledgments
** Update examples
*** Use actual path to Guile interpreter in the shebang
    Executables will be produced during building of the Guile-SSH.
*** Handle `guile-ssh-error' on `server-accept'
*** Catch `guile-ssh-error' on reading from a port
*** ssshd
**** Add `--port', `--ssh-debug' and `--pid-file' option
**** Store the PID in a file
     instead of printing it to stdout.
**** Handle password authentication correctly
*** sssh
**** Add `--ssh-debug' option
** Improve automated tests
*** Prevent sssh-ssshd from asking of a SSH agent for keys
*** Make parallel tests work

* Changes in version 0.5.0 (2014-02-05)
** Implement Guile-SSH channels as GNU Guile ports.
   Now channels can be used with regular procedures such as `display',
   `write' and `read-line'.
** `session-set!' and `server-set!' now take log-verbosity as a symbol
   Use symbols to represent log levels instead of numbers.
** Remove duplicates of some session options
   Remove duplicates that are existed for some Guile-SSH session
   options: `port-str' (duplicates `port', differs only in expected
   type of value), `log-verbosity-str' (duplicates `log-verbosity',
   differs only in expected type of value), `add-identity' (duplicates
   `identity', no differences).
** New `userauth-autopubkey!' procedure.
   The procedure can be used for public key authentication with a SSH
   agent.
** New procedures.
   `channel-set-stream!', `channel-get-stream', `session?', `server?',
   `message?'.
** Remove procedures.
   These procedures are removed due to changes in Guile-SSH channel
   API: `close-channel!', `channel-poll' `free-channel!',
   `channel-read`, `channel-write'.
** Add documentation in Texinfo format
   The Guile-SSH reference manual in Info format will be installed on
   `make install' into `${prefix}/share/info' directory.
** Update sssh/ssshd example.
*** `examples/sssh.scm' and `examples/ssshd.scm' are updated
    to use the new Guile-SSH channel API.
*** `sssh.scm` now uses `userauth-autopubkey!'
*** `ssshd.scm' now parses command-line options
    See `ssshd.scm --help'.
** Add echo server/client example.
   See `examples/echo' directory.
** Add automated tests.
   See `tests/' directory.

* Changes in version 0.4.0 (2013-11-26)
** Port the library to GNU Guile version 2.0
   Now the library works with GNU Guile version 2.0 as well as 1.8.
** Remove "ssh:" prefix from procedures names.
   If it is needed, an user's prefix can be added by setting a renamer
   for a module on loading.  See the documentation for the GNU Guile
   module system.
** Implement basic SSH server API.
** Fix a memory corruption in `channel-read'
   The problem was seen on reading of an output from "lsb_release -a"
   command.
** Fix a memory corruption during GC'ing of SSH keys.
** Fix a bug in `session-set!'
   Fix the bug that leads to an error if the user tried to set a
   correct boolean option.
** New `channel-write' procedure.
** New `channel-request-pty' procedure.
** New `channel-request-shell' procedure.
** New `channel-set-pty-size!' procedure.
** Fix the name of `write-known-host!'
   The procedure was called `authenticate-server' by mistake.  Rename
   it to `write-known-host!'.
** Change error handling in some procedures.
   Now `write-known-host!', `channel-open-session',
   `channel-request-exec', `channel-request-env', `close-channel!',
   throw an exception on error.  The return value of these procedures
   now is undefined.
** `authenticate-server' now throws guile-ssh-error exception on error.
   Don't return the 'error symbol, throw an exception instead.
** `server-set!' now throws guile-ssh-error exception on error.
   The return value now is undefined.
** Rename `make-session' to `%make-session'.
   See `make-session' below.
** New `make-session' procedure.
   This is a convenient wrapper for `%make-session' which allows to
   set session options by passing them as keywords.
** Rename `connect' to `connect!'.
** Fix a typo in an option symbol
   'strcthostkeycheck -> 'stricthostkeycheck
** Fix an infinite loop in `public-key->string'.
   The problem was observed on Ubuntu GNU/Linux 10.04 LTS.
** Add examples to the repository.
   See the "examples/" directory.
** Improve printing of SSH keys, channels and messages.
   Examples: #<public rsa key>, #<open ssh channel>

* Changes in version 0.3.1 (2013-07-14)
** Use a simpler method to GC'ing of SSH channels.
   The idea is that we don't have to free resources allocated by a
   channel during its GC'ing, because these resources will be freed
   anyway when the related SSH session is GC'ed.  However, to be able
   to control allocating of resources more precisely, introduce new
   procedure ssh:free-channel! that can be used for freeing resources
   allocated by a channel.
** ssh:free-channel!
   New procedure.
** Make the library thread-safe.

* Changes in version 0.3 (2013-07-13)
** Improve working with public keys.
   Because some libssh functions are working with public keys
   represented as a ssh_string instead of a ssh_public_key, we try to
   hide this peculiarity so all kinds of keys are look like a <key>
   class from the Scheme perspective.
** Fix segmentation faults on GC'ing of SSH objects.
   The program doesn't crashes anymore during GC'ing of SSH objecs.
** ssh:public-key-from-file
   Make it work.  Return newly created <key> instance or #f on error.
** ssh:public-key->string
   Take a key as a <key> instance.
** ssh:private-key-from-file
   Fix call to an undefined procedure.  Return #f on error.
** ssh:get-key-type
   New procedure.  The procedure returns type for a passed <key>
   instance.  Possible types are: 'dss, 'rsa, 'rsa1, 'unknown
** ssh:userauth-get-list
   New procedure.  The procedure returns a list of available
   authentication methods for a given SSH session
** ssh:channel-read
   Fix call to an undefined procedure.  Throw guile-ssh-error
   exception on error.
** ssh:close-channel!
   Fix return value: return #t if channel is closed successfully, #f
   otherwise.
** ssh:blocking-flush!
   Return 'error by default.
** ssh:session-set!
   Fix a bug with uint32 options setting.
** SSH objects now comparable.

* Changes in version 0.2 (2013-05-25)
** Release of the first stable version of Guile-SSH.
