* Unreleased
** Remove dependency on libgcrypt added by a mistake
** Fix a bug in the channel implementation
   The bug could occasionally manifest itself on channel reading as the
   following error:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+END_EXAMPLE
** New `server-get' procedure in (ssh server)
   The procedure can be used to retrieve server options.
** New `channel-get-exit-status' procedure in (ssh channel)
   The procedure allows to get exit status of an executed command from a
   channel.
** New `channel-request-send-exit-status' procedure in (ssh channel)
   The procedure can be used to send the exit status to a client.
** Improve printing of Guile-SSH server objects
** Update examples
*** sssh
    - Check exit status of an executed command.
*** ssshd
    - Send exit status to the client according to the result of command
      execution.
** Update documentation
   - Add description of the new procedures.

* Changes in version 0.7.1 (2014-10-11)
** New `%get-libssh-version' procedure in (ssh version)
   The procedure can be used to get libssh version in the "raw" format such
   as: "0.6.3/openssl/zlib".
** New `get-crypto-library' procedure in (ssh version)
   The procedure returns name of a cryptographic library with which libssh was
   compiled.
** New `zlib-support?' procedure in (ssh version)
   The procedure checks if zlib support is enabled in libssh.
** New `set-log-verbosity!' procedure in (ssh log)
   The procedure sets global libssh log verbosity.
** New `get-log-verbosity' procedure in (ssh log)
   The procedure gets global libssh log verbosity.
** New `make-keypair' procedure in (ssh key)
   The procedure can be used to generate a new keypair with the specified
   parameters.
** New `private-key-to-file' procedure in (ssh key)
   The procedure can be used to export a private key to a file (doesn't work
   if libssh 0.6.3 is compiled with GCrypt).
** Changes in tests
*** Fix "end of file" errors in tests
   Fix the following kind of errors in tests:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ERROR: In procedure scm_i_lreadparen: /path/to/guile-ssh/sources/tests/./client-server.scm:272:34: end of file
#+END_EXAMPLE
   Thanks to Ludovic Courtès for reporting the issue and for a good advice how
   to fix that.
*** Don't perform ECDSA key tests if libssh is compiled with GCrypt
    libssh 0.6.3 does not support ECDSA keys if compiled with GCrypt instead
    of OpenSSL.  Thus, ECDSA key tests used to fail.  Now there is a check
    that prevents these tests from execution in case when libssh 0.6.3 is
    compiled with GCrypt.
** Update documentation
   - Add description of the new procedures.
   - Add note about ECDSA keys support with GCrypt library.

* Changes in version 0.7.0 (2014-08-31)
** Require GNU Guile 2.0
** Require libssh 0.6.3
** Change `get-public-key-hash'
*** Move the procedure to (ssh key)
*** Return the hash as a bytevector
*** Accept a public key as the first argument
*** Accept a hash type as the second argument
    Possible types are: 'md5, 'sha1
** (ssh auth) procedures now throw an exception if the session is not connected
** (ssh channel) procedures now handle closed and freed channels
   - `channel-open?' returns `#f' if the channel has been closed freed.
   - `channel-open-session' and `channel-eof?' throw to `guile-ssh-error' if
     the channel has been closed and freed.
   - `channel-request-env', `channel-request-exec', `channel-request-pty',
     `channel-request-shell', `channel-set-pty-size!', `channel-set-stream!',
     `channel-get-stream' now throw `wrong-type-arg` if the channel is closed.
** Some (ssh session) procedures now throw an exception if the session is not connected
   These procedures are:
   - `get-protocol-version'
   - `authenticate-server'
   - `get-server-public-key'
   - `write-known-host!'
** Change `userauth-pubkey!'
*** Rename it to `userauth-public-key!'
*** Change arguments
** `blocking-flush!' now returns `error' symbol on error
   instead of throwing of an exception
** `connect!' now returns `error' symbol on error
   instead of throwing of an exception
** `authenticate-server' now returns `error' symbol on error
   instead of throwing of an exception
** `private-key-from-file' now takes only a file name
** New (ssh log) module
** Rename `userauth-pubkey-auto!' to `userauth-public-key/auto!'
** New `userauth-public-key/try' procedure in (ssh auth)
** New `bytevector->hex-string' procedure in (ssh key)
** New `session-get' procedure in (ssh session)
** New `channel-get-session' procedure in (ssh channel)
** New `message-get-session' procedure in (ssh message)
** Improve printing of Guile-SSH objects
*** Print more detailed information about `session' object
    Print user name, host name and current state of a `session' object.
*** Print object address for `channel' object
*** Print object address for `message' object
*** Print object address for `key' object
** Changes in tests
*** Add tests for Guile-SSH keys
*** Add tests for `authenticate-server' procedure
** Bug fixes
*** Fix a GC issue
    Keep a reference to the parent session in channels and messages to prevent
    the session from premature GC'ing.  Without that GC could free a session
    even if there are live channels and by that break the channels.
*** `public-key?' and `private-key?' now produce correct result
    Functions now return `#f' if the given argument is not a Guile-SSH
    key object.
** Documentation update
*** Fix old URLs to Guile-SSH repository in the `Installation' chapter
*** Add an overview of programming with Guile-SSH to the "Examples" chapter

* Changes in version 0.6.0 (2014-03-23)
** Remove username from parameter list of auth procedures
   `userauth-password!' and `userauth-pubkey!' don't take a username
   as a parameter anymore.  Rationale: According to libssh 0.6 docs,
   most server implementations do not permit changing the username
   during authentication.  Moreover, the parameter was deprecated in
   libssh 0.5.3.

   Elimination of the username makes Guile-SSH Auth API clearer and
   simpler.  Username can be set either on creation of a session or by
   calling of `session-set!' procedure.
** `server-accept' now throws `guile-ssh-error' on error
** Improve reads from channels
   Return EOF immediately if the channel is closed instead of polling
   it for data (which causes notable latency on the first read).
   Thanks Ludovic Courtès for the patch.
** Compile Guile modules
   Compile Guile modules and install compiled files if GNU Guile 2.0.x
   is available.
** Update Texinfo documentation
*** Update Auth API description
*** Update Server API description
*** Update Acknowledgments
** Update examples
*** Use actual path to Guile interpreter in the shebang
    Executables will be produced during building of the Guile-SSH.
*** Handle `guile-ssh-error' on `server-accept'
*** Catch `guile-ssh-error' on reading from a port
*** ssshd
**** Add `--port', `--ssh-debug' and `--pid-file' option
**** Store the PID in a file
     instead of printing it to stdout.
**** Handle password authentication correctly
*** sssh
**** Add `--ssh-debug' option
** Improve automated tests
*** Prevent sssh-ssshd from asking of a SSH agent for keys
*** Make parallel tests work

* Changes in version 0.5.0 (2014-02-05)
** Implement Guile-SSH channels as GNU Guile ports.
   Now channels can be used with regular procedures such as `display',
   `write' and `read-line'.
** `session-set!' and `server-set!' now take log-verbosity as a symbol
   Use symbols to represent log levels instead of numbers.
** Remove duplicates of some session options
   Remove duplicates that are existed for some Guile-SSH session
   options: `port-str' (duplicates `port', differs only in expected
   type of value), `log-verbosity-str' (duplicates `log-verbosity',
   differs only in expected type of value), `add-identity' (duplicates
   `identity', no differences).
** New `userauth-autopubkey!' procedure.
   The procedure can be used for public key authentication with a SSH
   agent.
** New procedures.
   `channel-set-stream!', `channel-get-stream', `session?', `server?',
   `message?'.
** Remove procedures.
   These procedures are removed due to changes in Guile-SSH channel
   API: `close-channel!', `channel-poll' `free-channel!',
   `channel-read`, `channel-write'.
** Add documentation in Texinfo format
   The Guile-SSH reference manual in Info format will be installed on
   `make install' into `${prefix}/share/info' directory.
** Update sssh/ssshd example.
*** `examples/sssh.scm' and `examples/ssshd.scm' are updated
    to use the new Guile-SSH channel API.
*** `sssh.scm` now uses `userauth-autopubkey!'
*** `ssshd.scm' now parses command-line options
    See `ssshd.scm --help'.
** Add echo server/client example.
   See `examples/echo' directory.
** Add automated tests.
   See `tests/' directory.

* Changes in version 0.4.0 (2013-11-26)
** Port the library to GNU Guile version 2.0
   Now the library works with GNU Guile version 2.0 as well as 1.8.
** Remove "ssh:" prefix from procedures names.
   If it is needed, an user's prefix can be added by setting a renamer
   for a module on loading.  See the documentation for the GNU Guile
   module system.
** Implement basic SSH server API.
** Fix a memory corruption in `channel-read'
   The problem was seen on reading of an output from "lsb_release -a"
   command.
** Fix a memory corruption during GC'ing of SSH keys.
** Fix a bug in `session-set!'
   Fix the bug that leads to an error if the user tried to set a
   correct boolean option.
** New `channel-write' procedure.
** New `channel-request-pty' procedure.
** New `channel-request-shell' procedure.
** New `channel-set-pty-size!' procedure.
** Fix the name of `write-known-host!'
   The procedure was called `authenticate-server' by mistake.  Rename
   it to `write-known-host!'.
** Change error handling in some procedures.
   Now `write-known-host!', `channel-open-session',
   `channel-request-exec', `channel-request-env', `close-channel!',
   throw an exception on error.  The return value of these procedures
   now is undefined.
** `authenticate-server' now throws guile-ssh-error exception on error.
   Don't return the 'error symbol, throw an exception instead.
** `server-set!' now throws guile-ssh-error exception on error.
   The return value now is undefined.
** Rename `make-session' to `%make-session'.
   See `make-session' below.
** New `make-session' procedure.
   This is a convenient wrapper for `%make-session' which allows to
   set session options by passing them as keywords.
** Rename `connect' to `connect!'.
** Fix a typo in an option symbol
   'strcthostkeycheck -> 'stricthostkeycheck
** Fix an infinite loop in `public-key->string'.
   The problem was observed on Ubuntu GNU/Linux 10.04 LTS.
** Add examples to the repository.
   See the "examples/" directory.
** Improve printing of SSH keys, channels and messages.
   Examples: #<public rsa key>, #<open ssh channel>

* Changes in version 0.3.1 (2013-07-14)
** Use a simpler method to GC'ing of SSH channels.
   The idea is that we don't have to free resources allocated by a
   channel during its GC'ing, because these resources will be freed
   anyway when the related SSH session is GC'ed.  However, to be able
   to control allocating of resources more precisely, introduce new
   procedure ssh:free-channel! that can be used for freeing resources
   allocated by a channel.
** ssh:free-channel!
   New procedure.
** Make the library thread-safe.

* Changes in version 0.3 (2013-07-13)
** Improve working with public keys.
   Because some libssh functions are working with public keys
   represented as a ssh_string instead of a ssh_public_key, we try to
   hide this peculiarity so all kinds of keys are look like a <key>
   class from the Scheme perspective.
** Fix segmentation faults on GC'ing of SSH objects.
   The program doesn't crashes anymore during GC'ing of SSH objecs.
** ssh:public-key-from-file
   Make it work.  Return newly created <key> instance or #f on error.
** ssh:public-key->string
   Take a key as a <key> instance.
** ssh:private-key-from-file
   Fix call to an undefined procedure.  Return #f on error.
** ssh:get-key-type
   New procedure.  The procedure returns type for a passed <key>
   instance.  Possible types are: 'dss, 'rsa, 'rsa1, 'unknown
** ssh:userauth-get-list
   New procedure.  The procedure returns a list of available
   authentication methods for a given SSH session
** ssh:channel-read
   Fix call to an undefined procedure.  Throw guile-ssh-error
   exception on error.
** ssh:close-channel!
   Fix return value: return #t if channel is closed successfully, #f
   otherwise.
** ssh:blocking-flush!
   Return 'error by default.
** ssh:session-set!
   Fix a bug with uint32 options setting.
** SSH objects now comparable.

* Changes in version 0.2 (2013-05-25)
** Release of the first stable version of Guile-SSH.
