;; This module contains API that is used for SSH key management.
;;
;; These methods are exported:

;;   key?
;;   public-key?
;;   private-key?
;;   make-keypair
;;   get-key-type
;;   public-key->string
;;   string->pubilc-key
;;   public-key-from-file
;;   private-key->public-key
;;   private-key-from-file
;;   private-key-to-file
;;   get-public-key-hash
;;   bytevector->hex-string
